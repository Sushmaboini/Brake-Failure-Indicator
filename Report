Brake Failure Indicator System
Overview
The Brake Failure Indicator System is an innovative safety solution designed to monitor brake performance in vehicles. By leveraging microcontrollers and pressure sensors, this project aims to enhance vehicle safety by providing real-time alerts for potential brake failures.
Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors brake fluid pressure to detect abnormalities.
Alert System: Triggers visual (LED indicators) and auditory (buzzer) alerts when abnormal pressure levels are detected.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple design that ensures easy integration into existing vehicle systems.
Data Logging: Records pressure data for analysis and maintenance purposes.
Components Used
Microcontroller: [Specify model, e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi]
Pressure Sensors: To measure brake fluid pressure.
LEDs: For visual alerts.
Buzzer: For auditory notifications.
Resistors and Connectors: Basic electronic components for circuit assembly.
Circuit Design
The circuit is designed to connect the pressure sensors to the microcontroller, which processes the sensor data and activates the alert system as needed.
A schematic diagram is provided in the repository for reference.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Connect the components as per the schematic diagram.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Ensure proper calibration of the pressure sensors.
Usage
The system continuously monitors brake fluid pressure during vehicle operation. If a failure condition is detected (e.g., pressure drop below a certain threshold), the system will activate alerts to notify the driver.
Future Enhancements
Implement wireless communication for remote monitoring.
Add a display module to show real-time pressure readings.
Integrate additional sensors for comprehensive vehicle diagnostics.
